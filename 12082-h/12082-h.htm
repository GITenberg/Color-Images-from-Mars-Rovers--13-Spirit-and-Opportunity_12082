<b>Mars Attacks!</b>
</p>

<p>
I was browsing the NASA web site for photos from the Mars rovers, but most of
them are black and white. Then I noticed they have the raw images posted that
can be combined into color photos, so I combined a bunch of them into "living
color." Here they are:<br /><br />

<p>
The color is not perfect on these, but it should be in the neighborhood. There
are a lot of variables. The cameras are calibrated differently from time to
time, there are different bandwidths available in different images, and the sun
is at different angles.
</p>

<p>
In these photos, 3 to 6 images were taken, one after another, using different
bandwidth filters. There may be 5 minutes pass from the first to the last
image, so a shadow may move a little bit during that time. An interesting
effect of this is an occasional rainbow strip on the edge of shadows.
</p>

<p>
The image file names include information such as camera type, time taken,
location, etc. Here is the full info:

</p>

<p>
The image on this site have the filter and sometimes the Left or Right
designator removed. If L or R is missing, then they were taken with the Left
camera, which uses visible light filters.
</p>

<p>
These images were taken with the panoramic camera, because it's the one that
uses color filters. The filters used vary from image to image. The available
filters are:

Everything gets kind of fuzzy from this point on. The visible light bandwidths
are not even sharply delimited. The bandwidths in the Martian cameras don't
necessarily match the color bandwidths on Earthling computers. In a lot of the
images some of the bandwidths are missing. For example, this image:
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a href="images/2P130442467EFF0900P2553M1.jpg">
<img src="images/small_2P130442467EFF0900P2553M1.jfif" width="144" height="144" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
only uses filters 4, 5, and 7, which more or less correspond to reddish-orange,
yellow-green, and violet. There is a hole or two in the spectrum, notably red
and blue, so it ends up looking a little weird. But it's still much better than
black and white.
</p>

<p>
Some of the images from Mars use filters 2, 5, and 7, or some wide range like
that. This provides more information for scientific analysis, but it doesn't
look normal when combined. That is, if there is a "normal" for pictures from
Mars. I skipped most of these.
</p>

<p>
The right pan camera filters are mainly longer wavelength in the ultraviolet
range. I only included one of those pictures, mostly because I wondered what it
would look like:
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a href="images/1P130580071EFF0448P2571RM1.jpg">
<img src="images/small_1P130580071EFF0448P2571RM1.jfif" width="144" height="144" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>
I used Photo Mud to merge the separate images. In fact, I wrote the Merge Color
Separation function in Photo Mud so I could do this. You can download a test
version here:
</p>

<p class="letter">
http://xpda.com/photomudsetup.exe
</p>

<p>
When Photo Mud version 3.0 is released in a few days, I'll replace this file
with a 30-day trial version. If you download the test version before then, you
can have a free update to the release version without a 30-day limit. Let me
know if you find any "design considerations" or other things that don't work.
</p>

<p>
Here's where to get the latest raw images from Mars:
</p>

<p class="letter">
http://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all
</p>

<p>
Some of the NASA pictures show mainly red on Mars, such as this
              panorama:
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img src="images/color_panorama_sol6-A6R1_br2_small.jfif" width="192" height="72" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
But the colors in the corners of this sundial in the base of the photo from
looks quite a bit different on earth than on the landscape photo. There is a
lack of blue in the Mars photo, or maybe even a translation of blue to red.
There's probably a good reason for this, since NASA has better software and
spent more time on it.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/sundial1_250.jfif" width="250" height="213"
alt="" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="images/sundial_small.jfif" width="192" height="155" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
It looks to me like NASA included filter 2, infrared light, in their red color
composition. In this image with filter 2, you can see how bright the lower
right color tab is:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/2P129996916ESF0506P2835L2M1.jfif" width="320" height="272" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
This one is filter 3, is visible red. The blue tab in the lower right is not
nearly as bright:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/2P129996993ESF0506P2835L3M1.jfif" width="320" height="272" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Here is a composition I did using infrared as red, and shifting the colors
toward that end of the spectrum. This is kind of like the sundial in the color
landscape.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/sundial-infrared.jfif" width="320" height="272" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Here's the image with "normal color" composition:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/sundial-normal.jfif" width="320" height="272" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
The second one looks a lot closer to the original photo above. In these two
images, the background dirt looks about the same, but these settings make a big
difference sometimes.

On sol 51 (March 15, 2004), Opportunity slowly rotated its left front wheel on the rock, abrading it in the same way that geology students use a scratch test to determine the hardness of minerals. The image on the right, taken by the rover's navigation camera on sol 51, shows the rock post-scuff. In this image, it is apparent that Opportunity scratched the surface of "Carousel" and deposited dirt that it was carrying in its wheel rims.<br/>

<br/>"Shoemaker's Patio" near the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity's landing site, shows finely layered sediments, which have been accentuated by erosion. The sphere-like grains or "blueberries" distributed throughout the outcrop can be seen lining up with individual layers. This observation indicates that the spherules are geologic features called concretions, which form in pre-existing wet sediments. Other sphere-like grains, such as impact spherules or volcanic lapilli (fragments of material between 2 and 64 millimeters or .08 and 2.5 inches in maximum dimension that are ejected from a volcano) are thought to be deposited with sediments and thus would form layers distinct from those of the rocks. This image was captured by the rover's panoramic camera on the 50th martian day, or sol, of the mission.<br/>

<br/>This image is of the exceptional rock called "Berry Bowl" in the "Eagle Crater" outcrop. The study of this "blueberry-strewn" area and the identification of hematite as the major iron-bearing element within these sphere-like grains helped scientists confirm their hypothesis that the hematite in these martian spherules was deposited in water. To separately analyze the mineralogical content of three main features within this area -- blueberries, dust and rock -- it was important that the rock abrasion tool's brush was able to rest on a relatively berry-free spot. The rock's small size and crowd of berries made the 10-minute brushing a challenge to plan and execute. The successful brushing on the target whimsically referred to as "Near Empty" on the rover's 48th sol on Mars left a dust-free impression for subsequent examination by the rover's spectrometers. No grinding was necessary on the rock because spectral data obtained on the dust-free surface were sufficient to verify that the rock's chemical composition differs significantly from the hematite-rich berries.<br/>

<br/>the 3.1 millimeter-deep (just over one-tenth of an inch) hole ground by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity's rock abrasion tool in the target called "Mojo 2" on "Flatrock" was taken on the 44th martian day, or sol, of the mission. It will help complete the chemical analysis of the lowest layer of the outcrop in the crater where the rover now resides. After a brief brushing on sol 45, the science team plans to place Opportunity's spectrometers on the hole to collect data vital to their understanding of this impressive outcrop. <br/><br/>Scientists believe that the spherule or "blueberry" in the upper right area of the circular impression was sliced in half by the rock abrasion tool. "Blueberries" are a known obstruction to the grinding tool that cause it to terminate its sequence. Despite the stall, the rock abrasion tool abraded "Flatrock" for one hour and five minutes, producing a cavity ripe for investigation.<br/>

The lighter-colored areas in the image are clean sections of the magnet virtually free of dust, and the dark areas are places where dust has collected. Dust particles in the martian atmosphere are estimated to be about 1 micrometer in size (1/1000th of a millimeter or 1/1000th of .04 inches). <br/><br/>The material below the magnet's aluminum surface is laid out in concentric rings, giving the image a bull's-eye appearance. The magnet was designed in this configuration to collect as much atmospheric dust as possible. Spirit and Opportunity each carry seven magnets.<br/>

The rover's instrument deployment device, or arm, will begin studying the fresh soil at the bottom of this trench later today for clues to its mineral composition and history. Scientists chose this particular site for digging because previous data taken by the rover's miniature thermal emission spectrometer indicated that it contains crystalline hematite, a mineral that sometimes forms in the presence of water. The brightness of the newly-exposed soil is thought to be either intrinsic to the soil itself, or a reflection of the Sun.<br/>

This image was taken by NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit on sol 79 after completing a two-location brushing on the rock dubbed "Mazatzal." A coating of fine, dust-like material was successfully removed from targets named "Illinois" (right) and "New York" (left), revealing clean rock underneath. The center of the two brushed spots are approximately 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) apart and were aggressively analyzed by the instruments on the robotic arm on sol 80. On sol 81, the rover drilled into the New York target to expose the original rock underneath.<br/>

This hazard-avoidance camera image was taken by NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit on sol 79 after completing a two-location brushing on the rock dubbed "Mazatzal." A coating of fine, dust-like material was successfully removed from targets named "Illinois" (right) and "New York" (left), revealing clean rock underneath. In this image, Spirit's panoramic camera mast assembly, or camera head, can be seen shadowing Mazatzal's surface. The center of the two brushed spots are approximately 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) apart and were aggressively analyzed by the instruments on the robotic arm on sol 80. On sol 81, the rover drilled into the New York target to expose the original rock underneath.<br/><br/>Note: The raw images are under the pan camera with color filters. ???<br/>

NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit took this panoramic camera image of the rock target named "Mazatzal" on sol 77 (March 22, 2004). It is a close-up look at the rock face and the targets that will be brushed and ground by the rock abrasion tool in upcoming sols. <br/><br/>Mazatzal, like most rocks on Earth and Mars, has layers of material near its surface that provide clues about the history of the rock. Scientists believe that the top layer of Mazatzal is actually a coating of dust and possibly even salts. Under this light coating may be a more solid portion of the rock that has been chemically altered by weathering. Past this layer is the unaltered rock, which may give scientists the best information about how Mazatzal was formed. <br/><br/>Because each layer reveals information about the formation and subsequent history of Mazatzal, it is important that scientists get a look at each of them. For this reason, they have developed a multi-part strategy to use the rock abrasion tool to systematically peel back Mazatzal's layers and analyze what's underneath with the rover's microscopic imager, and its Moessbauer and alpha particle X-ray spectrometers. <br/><br/>The strategy began on sol 77 when scientists used the microscopic imager to get a closer look at targets on Mazatzal named "New York," "Illinois" and "Arizona." These rock areas were targeted because they posed the best opportunity for successfully using the rock abrasion tool; Arizona also allowed for a close-up look at a range of tones. On sol 78, Spirit's rock abrasion tool will do a light brushing on the Illinois target to preserve some of the surface layers. Then, a brushing of the New York target should remove the top coating of any dust and salts and perhaps reveal the chemically altered rock underneath. Finally, on sol 79, the rock abrasion tool will be commanded to grind into the New York target, which will give scientists the best chance of observing Mazatzal's interior. <br/><br/>The Mazatzal targets were named after the home states of some of the rock abrasion tool and science team members.<br/>

This image of the rock called "Mazatzal" was taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit. It reveals some interesting features on this future rock abrasion tool target, including variants in tone, a sugary surface texture and scalloped areas where parts of the rock seem to have been worn away. Mazatzal's uniqueness is made even more obvious when it is compared to the more typical, basaltic rock in the lower right of the image.<br/>

The Mars Exploration Rover Spirit acquired this navigation camera image on the 72nd martian day, or sol, of its mission (March 15, 2004), after digging its wheel into the drift dubbed "Serpent." Creating the commands that would generate this "scar" was not an easy task for rover controllers. Essentially, they had to choreograph an intricate dance for Spirit, maneuvering it up the side of the dune, shimmying its left front wheel a number of times to create the scuff, and then reversing to attain proper positioning for miniature thermal emission spectrometer observations. Before the task was finished, Spirit moved forward to put the scuff within proper reach of the rover's arm. <br/><br/>This scar allows the rover's instruments to see below the drift surface, to determine the composition of the materials. Initial results indicate that the drift material is similar to the basaltic sands that have been seen throughout Spirit's journey to the large crater dubbed "Bonneville." The material does not seem to be the same as that inside the crater. <br/><br/>Scientists are now looking to answer two questions: Why is the dark sand in the crater not the same as the dark sand in the drift? And why are there two different dark soil-type deposits in such a small place?<br/>

"Humphrey" at Gusev Crater, Mars, the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit's landing site. Spirit examined the lumpy rock with its suite of scientific instruments both before and after it drilled a hole into the rock surface on the 60th martian day, or sol, of its mission. "Humphrey" was one of several stops on the rover's way to the large crater dubbed "Bonneville."<br/>

The large, shadowed rock in the foreground is nicknamed "Sandia" for a mountain range in New Mexico. An imposing rock, "Sandia" is about 33 centimeters high and about 1.7 meters long.<br/>When lightened, this image reveals much about the pictured rocks, which the science team believes are ejected material, or ejecta, from the nearby crater called "Bonneville." Scientists believe "Sandia" is a basaltic rock that landed on its side after being ejected from the crater. The vertical lines on the side of the rock facing the camera are known by geologists as "flow banding" and typically run horizontally, indicating that "Sandia" is on its side. What look like small holes on the two visible sides of the rock are called vesicles; they were probably once gas bubbles within the lava.<br/>Many smaller rocks can be seen in the background of the image. Some rocks are completely exposed, while others are only peeking out of the surface. Scientists believe that two processes might be at work here: accretion, which occurs when winds deposit material that slowly buries many of the rocks; and deflation, which occurs when surface material is removed by wind, exposing more and more of the rocks.<br/><br/>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
