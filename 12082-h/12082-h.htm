I was browsing the NASA web site for photos from the Mars rovers, but most of
them are black and white. Then I noticed they have the raw images posted that
can be combined into color photos, so I combined a bunch of them into "living
color." Here they are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="spirit/sp.htm">Spirit images</a><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="opportunity/op.htm">Opportunity images</a><br>
<br>The color is not perfect on these, but it should be in the
neighborhood. There are a lot of variables. The cameras are calibrated
differently from time to time, there are different bandwidths available
in different images, and the sun is at different angles.<br>
<br>
In these photos, 3 to 6 images were taken, one after another, using
different bandwidth filters. There may be 5 minutes pass from the first
to the last image, so a shadow may move a little bit during that time.
An interesting effect of this is an occasional rainbow strip on the
edge of shadows.<br>
<br>
The image file names include information such as camera type, time taken, location, etc. Here is the full info:<br>

<br>
The image on this site have the filter and sometimes the Left or Right
designator removed. If L or R is missing, then they were taken with the
Left camera, which uses visible light filters.<br>
<br>
These images were taken with the panoramic camera, because it's the one
that uses color filters. The filters used vary from image to image. The
available filters are:<br>

<br>
Everything gets kind of fuzzy from this point on. The visible light
bandwidths are not even sharply delimited. The bandwidths in the
Martian cameras don't necessarily match the color bandwidths on
Earthling computers. In a lot of the images some of the bandwidths are
missing. For example, this image:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="spirit/2P130442467EFF0900P2553M1.jpg"><img src="images/small_2P130442467EFF0900P2553M1.jfif" border="0" width="144" height="144" alt=""></a><br>
<br>
only uses filters 4, 5, and 7, which more or less correspond to
reddish-orange, yellow-green, and violet. There is a hole or two in the
spectrum, notably red and blue, so it ends up looking a little weird.
But it's still much better than black and white.<br>
<br>
Some of the images from Mars use filters 2, 5, and 7, or some wide
range like that. This provides more information for scientific
analysis, but it doesn't look normal when combined. That is, if there
is a "normal" for pictures from Mars. I skipped most of these.<br>
<br>
The right pan camera filters are mainly longer wavelength in the ultraviolet range. I only included one of those pictures,
mostly because I wondered what it would look like:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="opportunity/1P130580071EFF0448P2571RM1.jpg"><img src="images/small_1P130580071EFF0448P2571RM1.jfif" border="0" width="144" height="144" alt=""></a><br>
<br>
I used Photo Mud to merge the separate images. In fact, I wrote the
Merge Color Separation function in Photo Mud so I could do this. You
can download a test version here:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://xpda.com/photomudsetup.exe">http://xpda.com/photomudsetup.exe</a><br>
<br>
When Photo Mud version 3.0 is released in a few days, I'll replace this
file with a 30-day trial version. If you download the test version
before then, you can have a free update to the release version without
a 30-day limit. Let <a href="mailto:bob@upperspace.com">me</a> know if you find any "design considerations" or other things that don't work.<br>
<br>
Here's where to get the latest raw images from Mars:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all">http://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all</a><br>
</p><p align="left">Some of the NASA pictures show mainly red on Mars, such as this
panorama:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/color_panorama_sol6-A6R1_br2_small.jfif" border="0" width="192" height="72" alt=""><br>
&nbsp;</p><p align="left">But the colors in the corners of this
<a href="http://origin.mars5.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_instru_calibr.html">
sundial</a> in the base of the photo from looks quite a bit different on earth
than on the landscape photo. There is a lack of blue in the Mars photo, or maybe
even a translation of blue to red. There's probably a good reason for this,
since NASA has better software and spent more time on it.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;<img src="images/sundial1_250.jfif" border="0" width="250" height="213" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img width="192" border="0" src="images/sundial_small.jfif" height="155" alt=""></p><p align="left">
It looks to me like NASA included filter 2, infrared light, in their red color
composition. In this image with filter 2, you can see how bright the lower right
color tab  is:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/2P129996916ESF0506P2835L2M1.jfif" border="0" width="320" height="272" alt=""><br>
<br>
This one is filter 3, is visible red. The blue tab in the lower right is not
nearly as bright:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/2P129996993ESF0506P2835L3M1.jfif" border="0" width="320" height="272" alt=""><br>
<br>
Here is a composition I did using infrared as red, and shifting the colors
toward that end of the spectrum. This is kind of like the sundial in the color
landscape.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/sundial-infrared.jfif" width="320" border="0" height="272" alt=""><br>
<br>
Here's the image with  "normal color" composition:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/sundial-normal.jfif" width="320" border="0" height="272" alt=""><br>
<br>
The second one looks a lot closer to the original photo above. In these two
images, the background dirt looks about the same, but  these settings make a big
difference sometimes.<br>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
